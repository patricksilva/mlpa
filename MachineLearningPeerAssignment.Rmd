## Introduction

The use of data from accelerometers on belt, forearm, arm and dumbell of 6 participants in order to evaluate the quality of the activities that had been done.

## Objective

Use the data and machine learning techniques in order to predict the manner the exercise activities had been done. 

<!-- Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). -->

## How the model was built

## How cross validation was used

## Prognosis about the expected out of sample error

## Reasons for the choices made



What you should submit

The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

Peer Review Portion

Your submission for the Peer Review portion should consist of 
a link to a Github repo with your R markdown and compiled HTML file describing your analysis.

Writeup to < 2000 words and less than 5 figs.


Course Project Prediction Quiz Portion

Apply your machine learning algorithm to the 20 test cases available in the test data above and submit your predictions in appropriate format to the Course Project Prediction Quiz for automated grading.

Reproducibility
Be sure that if they download the repo, they will be able to view the compiled HTML version of your analysis.
